So here I mark the begining of my adventures. I sit here in solitude in the small, cold space I dwell. The surrounding walls off white in color, are accented with handprints of motor oil and grease. Papers are lined across them, hanging from nails and tape. they are depictions, sketches of various objects. Some are of people or animals, others diagrams of concepts. The dull green carpet, matted and unkempt, is strewn with unwashed garments and plastic bottles and covered in rubbish. There is a single window to my left slightly opaque with dust, several plants rest upon the sill. The door to my right creaks at the hinges, as if to beckon others to when i leave my den. The bed behind me is unmade and disorderly, and is laden with various instruments and electronic. A computer upon a desk lies ahead. It is my pride and joy, where I store all my hopes and dreams.

Say hello to my world.
